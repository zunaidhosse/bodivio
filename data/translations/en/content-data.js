    "tip1_title": "Hydration is Key",
    "tip1_content": "Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water a day. Water is essential for metabolism, energy levels, and overall health. Carry a water bottle with you as a constant reminder.",
    "tip2_title": "Prioritize Protein",
    "tip2_content": "Include a source of lean protein with every meal. Protein helps with satiety (feeling full), muscle repair, and maintaining a healthy metabolism. Good sources include chicken, fish, eggs, tofu, lentils, and Greek yogurt.",
    "tip3_title": "Eat the Rainbow",
    "tip3_content": "Fill your plate with a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables. Different colors indicate different vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Aim for at least 5 servings a day.",
    "tip4_title": "Don't Fear Healthy Fats",
    "tip4_content": "Incorporate healthy fats from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil. Healthy fats are crucial for brain health, hormone production, and absorbing certain vitamins.",
    "tip5_title": "Mindful Eating",
    "tip5_content": "Pay attention to your food as you eat. Avoid distractions like your phone or TV. Chew slowly and savor each bite. This helps with digestion and recognizing your body's fullness cues.",
    "faq1_question": "How many calories should I eat per day?",
    "faq1_answer": "This varies greatly based on age, sex, activity level, and goals. A good starting point is to use an online Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) calculator. For weight loss, a deficit of 300-500 calories is typical. For muscle gain, a surplus of 300-500 calories is recommended.",
    "faq2_question": "Is it better to eat many small meals or three large ones?",
    "faq2_answer": "The best meal frequency is the one you can stick to consistently. Overall daily calorie and macronutrient intake are more important than the number of meals. Some people feel better with smaller, frequent meals, while others prefer larger, less frequent ones.",
    "faq3_question": "What should I eat before and after a workout?",
    "faq3_answer": "Before a workout (30-60 mins prior), focus on easily digestible carbohydrates for energy, like a banana or a small bowl of oats. After a workout (within 1-2 hours), consume a combination of protein (to repair muscles) and carbohydrates (to replenish glycogen stores), like a protein shake with a banana or grilled chicken with rice.",
    "faq4_question": "Do I need to take supplements?",
    "faq4_answer": "A balanced diet should provide most of the nutrients you need. However, some supplements can be beneficial. Protein powder is a convenient way to meet protein goals. Creatine is well-researched for strength and performance. Vitamin D may be necessary for those with limited sun exposure. Always consult a doctor before starting new supplements.",
